# Data file for the project

This folder will contain the data used to demo the algorithm. These data files contain information about 4 known places in the board where I touched 10 times each. 

* Data1st -> 10 taps made in position (5 , 5) from reference point
* Data2nd -> 10 taps made in position (10, 5) from reference point
* Data3rd -> 10 taps made in position (5, 15) from reference point
* Data4th -> 10 taps made in position (10,15) from reference point

testData.py-> Python code used originally to parse the data from data file
